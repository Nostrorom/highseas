## @Tailwind guys: Comments on deployment

As mentioned in the homepage of the app (if you've looked into it already), I ran into issues with deployment right before deadline (4am in France, doesn't help with clarity of thought to debug ;) ), which prevented me from putting all the content I wanted and also from providing a working app as my job application instead of a GitHub repo.

However, part of applying to something or doing a project is being able to meet a deadline, unforeseen issues or not, so here's where we are:

### Status at deadline time

What I was able to deliver was this GitHub repository, with a non-deployed app. 

It's not very readable, so I suggest you clone the repo then ```npm run dev``` to more easily navigate the content. 

In the interest of fairness to other applicants, I only allowed myself these updates past deadline time:

* removed my personal email from the repo. After a bit of sleep I figured this wasn't a very smart idea to leave it around here
* updated this readme with the content you are reading now, just for clarity's sake
* fixed the deployment issue, it had to do with the `polka` version for Heroku. Downgraded to latest stable release. The app is live here: [`highseas`](https://high-seas.herokuapp.com/) - I'm only providing this for the sake of readability, to save you the clone/run dev thing; I still consider having provided a non-deployed app at deadline time.


### Further content updates and development of the app

For my personal interest, I'll be working on fixing the app and updating the content in another repository, I just can't leave it that way :) 

I think my analysis of the color palette generator can be of interest to you, depending on what stage you are in development.

If nothing else, I'd rather share my thoughts to make it officially happen because it's a feature I would reaaaally use as an end-user if Tailwind adds it (better than me just creating a package for that). Let me know if you're interested in reading more about it.
